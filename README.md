# NewsLetter Signup

This repository serves to document my learning of using Javascript to host a site on Heroku, and using a website's API. 

The site is a signup form for a newsletter. The signup list is maintained using MailChimp's API.


## What I Have Used

**Express**
To create server

**Heroku-cli**

**MailChimp**
To maintain email list.

**body-parser**
Parse responses from API

**request**
Send http requests to API


## Getting Started (non-web version)

Key **node app.js** in terminal

Open your browser, type **localhost:3000/**, and press enter!
